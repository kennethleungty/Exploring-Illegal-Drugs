# Exploring Illegal Drugs in Singapore - A Data Perspective

I was recently curious about the nature of counterfeit health products traded in Singapore (as reported by Health Sciences Authority), and decided to write an article on the data analysis I performed on this subject.

Discovered several interesting findings, and felt it is a good topic to share (and publish as my first Medium post on Towards Data Science), especially since it is related to the good, the bad, and the ugly of drugs.

This repo shares the code I used to run the analyses.
